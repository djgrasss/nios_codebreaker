  "   THE KEYCARD READER IS BROKEN, SO HERE'S HOW TO GET INTO THE LAB:\n" \
  "     1. There are six buttons: Green, Blue, Red, Orange, Yellow, White\n" \
  "     2. Enter the correct four-color sequence, which is available from\n" \
  "        the department office between 9am and 4pm.\n" \
  "     3. If you get the code wrong, the lock will give you a hint for each\n" \

  "You begin to panic, but you glance at the clock and you realize you don't\n" \
  "have any time to panic.  So, you start trying to break the code...\n" \
  "\n" \
  "   HOW TO DO IT:\n" \
  "     1. Enter a four-letter code at the GUESS> prompt, and hit Enter.\n" \
  "         Valid letters are: G, B, R, O, Y, W\n" \
  "     2. Press KEY2 to try to open the door.\n" \
  "     3. If the door doesn't open, you'll get a hint:\n" \
  "         GUESS> ROYG\n" \
  "          Hint: CCCP\n" \
  "        This means that the G is in the right place, and R, O, and Y are\n" \
  "        all part of the code but are in the wrong position.  So, your next\n" \
  "        guess should have R, O, and Y in it (in a different order!) with\n" \
  "        G as the last letter.\n" \
  "     4. If the door does open, you pass the class.\n" \
  "     5. If 60 seconds expires, the lab is closed and you fail the class.\n" \
  "   GOOD LUCK!\n" \
